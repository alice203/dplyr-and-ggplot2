Work and practice with the dplyr- and ggplot2-package

This repository contains code I partly generated for class assignments (programming with R) and own individual projects to practice working with the R packages dplyr and ggplot2. 

I used the Olympics dataset available on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/data
